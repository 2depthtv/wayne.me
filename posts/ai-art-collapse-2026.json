We’re not in the hype cycle anymore—we’re in the displacement cycle. And the next domino, after visual art and motion, is code itself.</p>\n\n<h2>Art: From Starving Artist to Obsolete Input</h2>\n<p>Generative image tools didn’t just arrive; they rewrote economics. A 2025 Gartner forecast projected that <strong>90% of digital content would be AI-generated by 2026</strong>—a number that already feels conservative when you scroll ArtStation or DeviantArt today. Midjourney, Stable Diffusion derivatives, and Flux variants produce portfolio-grade illustrations in seconds for pennies, while human commissions now compete against instant alternatives.</p>\n<p>The human cost is stark. Freelance illustrators and concept artists face the highest immediate risk, according to 2024–2025 analyses of creative job disruption. Reports from platforms like Upwork and Fiverr show entry-level 2D art gigs declining 30–50% in volume since 2023, with average rates falling 25–40% as clients opt for “AI polish + minor human tweaks.” A Stanford GSB study on one major image marketplace found that AI introduction boosted overall sales but <strong>squeezed out human creators</strong>, shifting revenue toward AI-native sellers and aggregators.</p>\n<p>Animation is next—and faster than most admit. A 2025 Luminate Intelligence report on animation + AI highlighted widespread studio experimentation with Runway ML, Kling, and Sora derivatives for background generation, lip-sync, and in-betweening. Union surveys from 2024 already predicted <strong>over 200,000 entertainment jobs disrupted by 2026</strong> (CVL Economics estimate), with 3D modelers and compositors cited as especially vulnerable (33% and 25% exposure in one SAG-AFTRA adjacent poll). Storyboarders and key animators held out longer in predictions, but 2026 tools chaining image-to-video are closing that gap. The middle path—AI as accelerator—exists for senior directors, but juniors and mid-tier freelancers are watching gigs evaporate.</p>\n\n<h2>Programming: The Next Pillar to Fall</h2>\n<p>Visual creatives felt it first because pixels are easier to tokenize than logic. But code is just another sequence. GitHub Copilot now contributes <strong>46% of all code written by active users</strong> (2025 GitHub data), up from ~27% at launch, with retention rates around 88% on suggestions. Developers using it complete tasks <strong>55% faster</strong> (early controlled studies) and report 10–30% average productivity lifts across broader surveys. Google internally reported 25% of code AI-assisted by Q1 2025, crediting velocity gains—not replacement.</p>\n<p>Yet the macro numbers are harder to spin. A Stanford study covering 2022–2025 found <strong>employment among software developers aged 22–25 fell nearly 20%</strong>, aligning precisely with the Copilot/Sora/Devin wave. Stack Overflow’s 2025 developer survey showed 65% using AI weekly, but anecdotes from layoffs (77,999 tech jobs cut in 2025 alone, many citing AI efficiency) paint a picture of compression: fewer juniors needed, seniors augmented, mid-tier squeezed. Devin-class agents (2024–2025 prototypes) already finish small-to-medium projects autonomously in demos; production versions are 12–24 months out, but the trajectory is clear.</p>\n<p>What collapses isn’t intelligence—it’s economic scarcity. When marginal cost of creation approaches zero, the value of routine execution craters. Art lost its monopoly on novelty first; programming will lose its monopoly on implementation next. The survivors will be those who orchestrate systems, define problems, or build taste at a level machines can’t fake—yet.</p>\n\n<h2>The Bitter Math</h2>\n<p>AI image/animation tools created hundreds of thousands of adjacent tech jobs since 2021 (some estimates: 500k+ in supporting infrastructure), but they didn’t replace the lost commissions one-for-one. They centralized value into prompt engineers, model trainers, and platform owners. Programming follows suit: productivity multiplies, headcount doesn’t. The net is fewer humans paid per unit of output.</p>\n<p>I built tools in this space. I’ve seen the speed. I’ve also seen the Discord DMs from artists who can’t pay rent, coders ghosted after “we’re moving to AI-assisted workflows.” This isn’t inevitable doom—adaptation is possible—but pretending it’s all upside is gaslighting. The pillars are cracking. The question is whether we rebuild them with human intention at the center, or let the algorithm decide what gets created, animated, and shipped.</p>\n\n<p><em>wayne.exe</em><br><small>January 18, 2026 • Hickory, NC</small></p>"
